The first time I heard the words "Oh Captain, My Captain," was in eighth grade. Our new English teacher stood on a chair and said them loud and proud. I don't remember much from the eighth grade, but I remember watching Dead Poets Society with Robin Williams and deciding my life would be filled with adventure. At 13 who doesn't feel this way?  All the excitement and passion Mr.Keating awakened in the boys at Welton Academy was contagious. I had caught the Carpe diem fever and was ready to take on the world. I decided I wanted to be writer and director. I wanted to live the life all Americans dream of. When I grew up I wouldn't be stuck in a 9-5 I hated. At least that was the plan.

**"Seize the day. Because believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room is one day going to stop breathing, turn cold and die." ** John Keating *Dead Poets Society*

By age 31, I had a job I hated, and my outlook on life had changed. My Carpe diem fever had been broken by the responsibilities of adulting and the 2008 recession. It was replaced with a sense of economic survival and the common American virus, "Keeping up with the Jones." You know the one where you feel like you have to pursue the safe career, work countless hours so you can buy lots of stuff you don't need, miss out on the true joys of life, and die. 

Don't get me wrong I had some adventures. I moved from Tennessee to Michigan to be with the one I love. We've been together almost ten years now, and we're happy. He taught me to ride a dirt bike, and I joined roller derby. Both activities I love.

But here I was in a position I had vowed never to be in. I used two years of my life to earn associate's degree in Sleep Technology, and take a job just to pay the bills. The job itself wasn't terrible, but my third shift hours meant I was on the opposite schedule as my friends and family. I no longer had time for roller derby and all the new friends I had made. I saw my boyfriend in passing. He would get home as I was getting ready for work. Sure I made decent money, but it wasn't the life I wanted.

**So I quit**

Well not immediately, but fairly quickly. I enrolled in classes for Mechanical Engineering and took a job at a manufacturing plant. I worked days and went to school at night. It was a pay cut, and I have more school loan debt, but now I had a life. I now had nights and weekends off. I could spend time with friends and family and play roller derby again. Things were looking up.  

**Where does software development come into play**

After a few months at my new job, I was promoted to engineer technician and became responsible for various engineering process documents. And that's where I'm at today.

I enjoy my job and its everyday challenges. However, so many of the tasks are repetitive and a simple copy and paste. It's become boring and mind-numbing. 

So when I learned a Director of Operations (D.O.) from a different division had created a program to automate engineering tasks I became curious. I didn't realize the potential of writing programs for automating my tasks right away, but eventually, a light bulb turned on. All the data we put into his program could be manipulated and used for my tasks. I just needed to learn how to program. 

So when I had the time spent hours going line by line through his code. I printed it out and highlighted it, circled key words, and made notes. I used the debugger to activate the code line by line to see how each line changed the document. Eventually, it all began to make sense, and I could read his code without searching the internet multiple times. 

**"No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world." John Keating *Dead Poets Society***

It took me weeks, but I finally wrote my program to extract and format data for engineering to use. I was hooked. I was so excited that I had created something and it worked. I began finding new processes I could improve with programming. I even spent time at home working on it. 

After creating my first program my boss and the senior engineer were encouraging. I now have many projects that I am developing. My job is no longer boring or mind numbing. I now work as an engineer and software developer. 


**"Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary." John Keating *Dead Poets Society***

In the future, I'd like to work with engineering departments and write programs that work with computer aided design programs (CAD) and computer aided machining (CAM) software to automate repetitive tasks. I love problem-solving and "working smarter not harder." I'm currently developing programs for Catia V5 that will save us time and money.

So here I am a full-time Engineer Technician and full-time Mechanical Engineering student completing the Flat Iron online program. I'm busier than ever, but I'm happy. And I no longer feel like I gave up on my dream of having a job I enjoy. I may not be a writer or director, but I'm happy. That's the important thing.
