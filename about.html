<p>I'm studying computer programming while pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering. My goal is to automate repetitive tasks so engineers can focus on more important responsibilities and decrease project completion times. I'm currently developing programs for Catia and Excel. The great best part of my journey is I get to combine the two things I enjoy.                                                                                                                            "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."   Confucius
